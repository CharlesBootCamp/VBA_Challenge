# VBA_Challenge
Challenge 2 working with the Stock Analysis and VBAs to display Color Coordinated Data
# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project
Using the already given data, I created a VBA that used the 2017 and 2018 stock data to determine how the multiple stocks did over the courses of the year. This data would then be used to make an informed decision on what stocks to invest in. The given data sets contain the open, close, low, high, adjusted high, and the volume in the market each day; this data is then used to determine the yearly stock return as well as the volume of each stock.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to take the yearly data of multiple stocks to evaluate which ones are worth investing money into. In order to properly find which ones are good to invest in, the return has to be positive.
